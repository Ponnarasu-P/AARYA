## 🚨 3. Problem Statement & Why It Matters

### The Problem
Indian SMEs and startups often manage their finances through disconnected spreadsheets, scattered PDF invoices, bank statements, and manual follow-ups. Founders do not get immediate answers to practical, mission-critical questions such as:
* *"How many months of cash runway do we have left at our current burn rate?"*
* *"Which clients owe us money, and what are our immediate vendor payables?"*
* *"Can we safely afford to hire two new engineers next month?"*

While transaction data exists in abundance, **decision-ready operational insight does not**. Traditional accounting software merely records historical transactions, while generic dashboards display static numbers without executive context. Hiring full-time CFOs or human-led virtual CFO services remains expensive, slow, and dependent on manual interpretation.

### Why This Problem Matters in India
The Indian market exhibits strong willingness to pay for virtual CFO services, finance automation, and real-time cash visibility tools. The operational pain is particularly acute in India because businesses operate within unique regulatory and financial workflows — relying heavily on **GST (Goods & Services Tax)**, **TDS (Tax Deducted at Source)**, **UPI payments**, **bank transfers**, and legacy accounting software that requires human interpretation. This makes finance automation one of the strongest and most resilient SaaS wedges for an India-first startup.

---

## 🎯 4. Target Audience & Positioning

### Primary Users
* **Startup Founders & Co-founders**: Seeking immediate runway calculations, burn rate analysis, and hiring feasibility without waiting for month-end accounting reports.
* **SME Business Owners**: Wanting real-time cash visibility, vendor payable tracking, and customer due collections.

### Secondary Users
* **Finance Managers & Internal Accountants**: Looking to automate ledger ingestion and reporting workflows.
* **Chartered Accountants (CAs) & Fractional CFOs**: Managing multiple client portfolios and requiring an automated financial decision engine.

### Ideal First Customer
A growing Indian small business or seed-stage startup that already generates regular transaction data (CSV/Excel bank exports or invoice ledgers) but currently lacks real-time financial visibility and strategic cash forecasting.

---

## 💡 5. Product Vision & Differentiation

AARYA is designed to feel like an **intelligent financial decision engine**, not just a generic chatbot. The long-term vision is to become the **finance command center** that ingests business data, interprets financial health in plain English, and proactively recommends growth and survival actions.

## 🏗️ 7. System Architecture & Data Flow

AARYA operates as a decoupled full-stack application leveraging strict multi-tenancy, AI vector embeddings, and real-time database tools:

        API -->|POST /api/decisions/search| VectorDB
    end
```

### Key Architectural Innovations

#### 1. Multi-Tenant PostgreSQL with Strict Row Level Security (RLS)
Every company is isolated at the database level using Supabase RLS. All queries automatically bind to `auth.uid()` via the custom helper function `get_my_company_id()`, guaranteeing zero cross-company data leakage. The backend service-role key bypasses RLS only for bulk inserts, and is never exposed to the client.

#### 2. Hybrid Two-Stage Data Ingestion Pipeline
When messy accounting exports are uploaded without column mappings, AARYA executes a two-stage detection pipeline:
- **Stage 1 — Fuse.js Fuzzy Matching (zero API cost)**: Normalises headers (strips separators, lowercases) and checks against a curated synonym map covering 60+ financial terms across 4 canonical fields. Uses a fuzzy threshold of `0.35`.
- **Stage 2 — Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM Fallback**: If any required field (`amount`, `transaction_type`, `due_date`) cannot be mapped confidently, AARYA samples 5 rows and invokes Gemini 2.5 Flash in structured JSON mode (`responseMimeType: 'application/json'`, `temperature: 0`) to dynamically classify headers into the canonical schema.

#### 3. Tool-First AI Math Explainability (Anti-Hallucination)
To eliminate LLM hallucination in financial calculations, AARYA's chat controller enforces backend tool execution *before* generating any natural language response. The three live database tools return exact mathematical formulas (`calculation_explanation`) and top supporting transaction records (`supporting_transactions`), giving founders complete transparency into how numbers were derived. The Vercel AI SDK `streamText` with `stopWhen: stepCountIs(5)` limits runaway tool loops.

#### 4. Semantic AI Decision Memory (pgvector)
AARYA remembers context and learns from founder actions. It logs financial dilemmas, generates 768-dimensional embeddings using Google's `text-embedding-004`, and uses IVFFlat indexing in PostgreSQL (`lists = 100`) to perform cosine similarity searches — retrieving historical precedents when founders face similar strategic decisions.

| `subscription_status_enum` | `free`, `pro`, `enterprise` |
| `user_role_enum` | `owner`, `admin`, `viewer` |
| `transaction_type_enum` | `income`, `expense`, `transfer` |

### Database Functions & Triggers

| Function / Trigger | Type | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `get_my_company_id()` | SQL Function | Returns `company_id` of the currently authenticated user. Used inside all RLS policies to avoid per-row sub-query repetition. `SECURITY DEFINER` with locked `search_path`. |
| `create_company_and_owner(p_company_name, p_user_id)` | PL/pgSQL Function | Atomically creates a new company tenant and registers the caller as `owner`. Called by the backend onboarding flow using the service-role key. |
| `match_decisions(embedding, threshold, count, company_id)` | SQL Function | Cosine similarity search over `decision_memory_logs` using `<=>` distance operator. Returns rows above `p_match_threshold` similarity, ordered by relevance. |
| `handle_invited_user()` / `on_auth_user_created` | Trigger | Auto-creates a `public.users` row when an invited user accepts a Supabase Auth invite, reading `company_id` and `role` from invite metadata. |

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

All five tables have RLS enabled. Authenticated users can **only** access rows where `company_id` matches their own company via `get_my_company_id()`:

| Table | SELECT | INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `companies` | own company | — | `owner` only | — |
| `users` | same company | — | own row only | — |
| `financial_transactions` | same company | same company | `admin`+ | `admin`+ |

## 🤖 11. AI Tools — Backend Database Engine

The `getTools(companyId)` factory in [`src/services/aiTools.ts`](BACKEND/aarya-backend/src/services/aiTools.ts) exposes three Vercel AI SDK tools that execute against the live Supabase database. The Gemini model invokes these automatically based on the user's natural language question.

### Tool: `get_cash_flow`
**Trigger**: Any question about cash flow, burn rate, runway, income, or expenses.

Returns the following by querying `financial_transactions` filtered by `company_id`:

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `total_cash_in` | Sum of all `income` transactions |
| `total_cash_out` | Sum of all `expense` transactions |
| `net_cash_flow` | `cash_in - cash_out` |
| `derived_monthly_burn_rate` | Automatically derived from expense date span (`cashOut / monthsSpan`) — the model **never asks the user to provide burn rate manually** |
| `runway_months` | `netCashFlow / derivedBurnRate` (or `999+` if burn rate is zero) |
| `calculation_explanation` | Step-by-step formula string in plain English with INR formatting |
| `supporting_transactions` | Top 15 recent transactions (id, date, type, amount, description) |
| `_execution_meta` | Tool name, executed_at, duration_ms, records_analyzed, status |

### Tool: `get_receivables_and_payables`
**Trigger**: Questions about who owes money, outstanding bills, overdue invoices.

Returns:

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `receivables[]` | All `income` transactions with `is_overdue` flag (due_date < now) |
| `payables[]` | All `expense` transactions with `is_overdue` flag |
| `total_receivables` | Sum of all receivable amounts |
| `total_payables` | Sum of all payable amounts |

### Tool: `generate_founder_summary`
**Trigger**: Questions about overall business health, what's good/risky, strategic recommendations.

Performs a full aggregation pass and returns structured CFO intelligence:

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `what_is_good[]` | Positive highlights (e.g. net-positive operations, surplus) |
| `what_is_risky[]` | Risk flags (e.g. negative cash flow, overdue payables) |
| `what_needs_attention[]` | Urgent items (e.g. overdue receivables) |
| `recommendations[]` | Actionable strategic CFO recommendations with specific INR figures |
| `summary_stats` | `total_income`, `total_expense`, `net_position`, `overdue_receivables`, `overdue_payables` |

**Chat System Prompt Rules** (enforced by `chat.controller.ts`):
1. Always call tools *before* generating any financial answer — never hallucinate metrics.
2. Never ask the user to provide their burn rate — `get_cash_flow` derives it automatically.
3. For hypothetical/sample figures provided by the user, skip tool calls and analyse directly.
4. Always include a `**Tool Executed:** <name> (analyzed N records in Xms)` transparency footer.
5. Maximum 5 tool steps per request (`stopWhen: stepCountIs(5)`).

## 🔁 12. Hybrid Ingestion Pipeline — Deep Dive

The hybrid ingestion pipeline in [`src/modules/transactions/`](BACKEND/aarya-backend/src/modules/transactions/) and [`src/utils/`](BACKEND/aarya-backend/src/utils/) handles arbitrary CSV/XLS/XLSX accounting exports.

```mermaid

    B --> C{Manual<br/>mappings?}
    C -- Yes --> D[Validate mapping<br/>against headers]
    C -- No --> E[Stage 1: Fuse.js<br/>Fuzzy Match<br/>threshold = 0.35]
    E --> F{All required<br/>fields matched?}
    F -- Yes --> G[source = fuzzy]
    F -- No --> H[Stage 2: Gemini 2.5 Flash<br/>JSON mode, temp=0<br/>5 sample rows]

    N --> O[Batch INSERT<br/>500 rows per batch<br/>Supabase Admin]
    O --> P[Return IngestionResult<br/>inserted, errors, source, mappings]
```

**Supported Date Formats**: ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`, `DD/MM/YYYY`, `MM/DD/YYYY`, `DD-MM-YYYY`, and any format parseable by JavaScript's `Date` constructor.

**Supported Amount Formats**: Currency symbols (₹ £ $ € ¥), thousands separators (commas), negative amounts (sign inferred for `transaction_type` when no type column exists).

**Transaction Type Synonyms**:
- `income`: `income`, `revenue`, `credit`, `inflow`, `receipt`, `sales`, `gain`, `receivable`, `cr`
- `expense`: `expense`, `debit`, `outflow`, `payment`, `cost`, `spend`, `loss`, `outgoing`, `payable`, `dr`
- `transfer`: `transfer`, `move`, `shift`, `between`

## 🚀 13. Step-by-Step Setup & Full-Stack Launcher

You can launch both the backend API and frontend application simultaneously on Windows using the automated PowerShell boot script, or set them up manually.

### Prerequisites
* **Node.js**: `v18.0.0` or higher — [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* **Supabase Account**: Free tier works perfectly — [Sign up at Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
* **Google Gemini API Key**: Free tier available — [Get key at Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

---

### Step 1: Clone the Repository & Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/Ponnarasu-P/AARYA.git
cd AARYA

# Install backend dependencies
cd BACKEND/aarya-backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../../FRONTEND
npm install
cd ..
```

---

### Step 2: Supabase Database Setup

1. **Create a New Project**: In your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com), click **New Project**, select a region, set a database password, and wait ~2 minutes for provisioning.

2. **Enable pgvector**:
   - Navigate to **Database → Extensions** in the left sidebar.
   - Search for `vector` and toggle it **ON**.

3. **Run the SQL Migration**:
   - Go to **SQL Editor** and click **New query**.
   - Open [`BACKEND/aarya-backend/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`](BACKEND/aarya-backend/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql), copy the entire SQL contents, paste into the query editor, and click **Run** (▶).
   - *Verification*: Navigate to **Authentication → Policies** to confirm active RLS policies on all five tables.

---

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

#### Backend Environment (`BACKEND/aarya-backend/.env`)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` inside `BACKEND/aarya-backend/`:

```env
# ============================================================
# AARYA Backend – Environment Variables
# ============================================================

# ---- Supabase (Project Settings → API) ----
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsIn...
# WARNING: service_role key bypasses ALL RLS. Server-side only!
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsIn...

# ---- Google Gemini AI (https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) ----
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...

# ---- Server ----
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development

# ---- File Upload ----
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=10
```

#### Frontend Environment (`FRONTEND/.env`)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` inside `FRONTEND/`. You also need Supabase credentials for the browser client:

```env
# Supabase browser client (public anon key only — never the service role key)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsIn...

# Backend API base URL (leave empty for dev — Vite proxy handles /api/*)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=

# Gemini API key (for any client-side AI features)
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...

# App URL (used for OAuth callbacks, self-referential links)
APP_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

---

### Step 4: Launch Full-Stack Application

#### Option A — Automated (Recommended for Windows)

From the repository root, run the PowerShell boot script:

```powershell
.\start.ps1
```

This opens two separate PowerShell terminal windows and launches:
- **Backend API Server** → `http://localhost:3001` (with `tsx watch` hot-reloading)
- **Frontend Web App** → `http://localhost:5173` (with Vite HMR)

Then open **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)** in your browser.

#### Option B — Manual

```bash
# Terminal 1 – Backend
cd BACKEND/aarya-backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 – Frontend
cd FRONTEND
npm run dev
```

#### Available npm Scripts

**Backend** (`BACKEND/aarya-backend/`):

| Script | Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `dev` | `tsx watch src/server.ts` | Development server with hot-reload |
| `build` | `tsup src/server.ts --format esm --dts --out-dir dist` | Production ESM build |
| `start` | `node dist/server.js` | Run production build |
| `lint` | `tsc --noEmit` | TypeScript type-check only |

**Frontend** (`FRONTEND/`):

### 💬 AI CFO Chat & Tool Orchestration

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| `POST` | `/api/chat` | Vercel AI SDK streaming endpoint — executes live DB tools then streams Gemini response | ✅ |

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/chat \

## 🏛️ 15. Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a single-page application built with React 19 and managed through a single root `App.tsx` component that drives all view routing via a `ViewType` state variable.

### Application State Model (`BusinessState`)

```typescript
interface BusinessState {
  businessName: string;       // Company display name
  industry: string;           // Industry category
  currency: string;           // e.g., "INR"
  currencySymbol: string;     // e.g., "₹"
  startingBalance: number;    // Opening balance from onboarding
  ledger: LedgerItem[];       // Customer/vendor ledger entries
  invoices: Invoice[];        // Invoice records (Paid/Pending/Overdue)
  activities: Activity[];     // Audit trail entries
  chatHistory: CfoMessage[];  // CFO chat message history
  onboarded: boolean;         // Whether company setup is complete
  loggedIn: boolean;          // Auth session status (always from Supabase, not localStorage)
  userEmail?: string;
  companyId?: string;         // Backend company UUID
}
```

State is persisted to `localStorage` under key `aarya_business_state`, but `loggedIn` is always reset on mount and re-verified against the live Supabase session to handle JWT expiry correctly.

### Session Management & Routing Logic

```
Page Load
    ↓
supabase.auth.getSession()
    ├─ No session → show "landing"
    └─ Session exists → checkUserProfileAndRoute(user)
            ├─ public.users row exists (company_id found) → show "dashboard"
            └─ No public.users row → show "onboarding" (force company setup)

supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()
    ├─ SIGNED_IN → checkUserProfileAndRoute()
    └─ SIGNED_OUT → reset state → show "landing"
```

### API Client (`src/services/apiClient.ts`)
The centralized API client automatically:
1. Retrieves the current Supabase JWT via `getSession()` and attaches it as `Authorization: Bearer`.
2. Sets `Content-Type: application/json` for JSON bodies.
3. Intentionally omits `Content-Type` for `FormData` (file uploads) so the browser sets the correct multipart boundary.
4. Uses `VITE_API_BASE_URL` as the base (defaults to `''`, relying on the Vite `/api` proxy during development).

### UI Design System
- **Color Palette**: Deep purple gradient background (`#0f0c29` → `#15112e` → `#302b63`) with rose/mauve glassmorphic accents (`#D988A1`, `#8A5A7B`).
- **Background Effects**: 4 large blurred radial gradient orbs creating a dynamic ambient glow.
- **Always Dark Mode**: `document.documentElement.classList.add("dark")` enforced on mount.
- **Responsive Layout**: Desktop uses a fixed left `Sidebar` + main content panel. Mobile uses a `BottomNav` tab bar.
- **Animations**: Framer Motion (`motion` package) for smooth page transitions and micro-interactions.

---

## 🌐 16. Deployment

Both the backend and frontend are deployed independently on **Vercel**.

### Backend Deployment (`BACKEND/aarya-backend/vercel.json`)
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "src/server.ts", "use": "@vercel/node" }],
  "routes": [{ "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "src/server.ts" }]
}
```
Set all environment variables from `BACKEND/aarya-backend/.env.example` in the Vercel project settings.

### Frontend Deployment (`FRONTEND/vercel.json`)
```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```
All routes rewrite to `index.html` for SPA client-side routing. Set `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (pointing to deployed backend URL) in Vercel environment variables.

**Live deployment**: [https://aarya-frontend.vercel.app/](https://aarya-frontend.vercel.app/)

---

## 💼 18. Business Model

* **SaaS Subscription**: AARYA operates on a tiered SaaS subscription model:
  - **Free**: Basic dashboard, manual CSV upload, limited chat queries
  - **Pro**: Unlimited uploads, full AI chat, decision memory, snapshot history
  - **Enterprise**: Multi-user teams, CA client portal, API access, priority support
* **India-First Positioning**: Starting with the strong Indian SME and startup market (30M+ registered MSMEs) where the pain is most acute and regulatory context (GST, TDS, UPI) creates a natural moat.
* **Final Verdict**: Built to be an indispensable **finance decision copilot** with an India-first wedge — keeping the MVP simple, visible, and immediately useful for founders.

5. **Open** a Pull Request against `main`

### Development Guidelines
- Run `npm run lint` (TypeScript type-check) in both `BACKEND/aarya-backend/` and `FRONTEND/` before opening a PR.
- Backend API changes should include a corresponding migration in `migrations/` if they modify the database schema.
- All new API endpoints must use the `authenticateUser` middleware and scope queries to `req.user.company_id`.
- Frontend components should use the centralized `apiClient.ts` for all backend requests — never use raw `fetch` with hardcoded URLs.
